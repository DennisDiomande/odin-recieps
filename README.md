# odin-recieps
About the Project

odin-recipes is a foundational project as part of my web development journey with The Odin Project (TOP). This project focuses on building and structuring HTML pages to display a simple collection of recipes. The purpose is to create a main index page that links to a few individual recipe pages, showcasing my skills in HTML structuring and linking, while applying the foundational concepts I've learned so far.
Project Goals

    Build a basic HTML website with multiple pages.
    Use hyperlinks to connect the main index page with each individual recipe page.
    Practice effective structuring and organization of HTML content.

Skills Practiced

    HTML Basics: Structuring pages with HTML elements, including headers, lists, images, and links.
    Linking Pages: Using relative paths to link various pages within the site.
    Semantic HTML: Using tags that add meaning to the web page content.
